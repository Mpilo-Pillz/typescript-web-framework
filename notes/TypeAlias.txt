type Callback = ()=> {} // a function that returns and object
type Callback = ()=> void a function that does not return anything
type alias is an alternative to interface, he one above is for a function


on(eventName: string, callback: Callback): void {
        // this.events[eventName] // Callback[] or undefined
        const handlers = this.events[eventName] || []; //handlers is guarantted to be an array
    what the above means is its either goign to have an event (defined) or be undefined. if its undefined return an empty array instead
    }
